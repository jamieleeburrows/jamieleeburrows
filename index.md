## Professional self-assessment
   This project and the accompanying coursework did test my time management and development skills.  I have gotten a bit rusty over the years and realize that I need to regularly exercise those skills so that they don’t become stale.  I’ve never developed an ePortfolio before, and I am certain that the GitHub page is not the most dynamic page, but it does address all the related aspects to the whole effort for this final course.
   
   From the showcasing of my strengths, it did bring out to the forefront my code analysis skills.  I’ve always been very good at analyzing code from both the semantic and syntactic points of view.  I consider it my best skill.  
   
   This course has reminded me that I have many options now, and in the future, for where my career can and will take me.  If I decide to diverge from the managerial track and resume the developer track, I will need to invest some time and money into language-specific certification training programs.
   
   As of right now in my career, my development skills are used at a minimum.  For almost two years now, I have been the Product Support Manager for the Configurations Team at Sentry Data Systems, managing a team of 8 Technical Analysts, remotely.  When I first joined the company back in January of 2016, I worked as a regular Technical Analyst.  The learning curve was steep, and at the time I was unsure if I would be able to understand it successfully.  My mentors reassured me many times, and they helped me get over the hump of understanding.  Even before becoming a manager, collaborating in a team environment was absolutely a necessary skill for this work.  Especially since the entire team works remotely.  We have used several methods of communication and collaboration software over the years, but now, we use Microsoft Teams, and this application is perfect for the scenario that we work in.  Video conferencing with fellow teammates and clients alike, instant messaging, file sharing, planner task, wikis.  This tool has been a huge success in improving our collaboration.
   
   Communication with stakeholders is a large part of what I do in my current career.  The primary stakeholder for me is our clients.  Like with any organization, without the clients, the organization ceases to exist.  Even though I came into Sentry with a good set of communication skills, I have learned even more since, in large part to my current supervisor the Director of Product Support Services, Staci.  She has helped me hone my skills with regards to client communications, their perspectives of how they would see our processes, positively and negatively; also, with communications with other teams within the organization; and with people up and down my direct chain of command.  Regardless of the stakeholder, communication skills are vital to the success of any person or organization, and I feel that I have those skills and continue to refine and improve them.
   
   Over the years I learned about all different kinds of data structures, from records, link lists to binary trees.  All of them very useful in any number of scenarios.  Data structures are vital to everything that we do in the world, databases especially.  Databases are the definitive organization of data, and they form the backbone of the internet.  In the project work related to this course, I utilized arrays of objects.  Arrays in themselves are relatively straight forward to use, but when you combine them with Java classes and objects, it becomes a very powerful combination.  The simplicity of arrays allowed me to change the way information was being handled compared to the original code, which was using files.  The one disadvantage of using arrays instead of files was that the information stored in the arrays is volatile.  From an algorithm perspective, the use of classes is one of the key strengths that Java presents.  Java is very object-orientated as a language.  The built-in support and capabilities of Java for classes has and continues to be, a huge benefit to coders and developers in building quality and modular code, which is the optimum goal for any developer.
   
   Software engineering is so much bigger than developing. It involves multiple aspects including requirements analysis, design, and development.  Whether you are developing applications for desktop or mobile devices, the approach is still the same.  Not only for this course but for all the other courses that I have taken at SNHU, I have been about to expand, improve and refine those skills across all stages of software development.  When it comes to databases, my skillset entering this degree program was already very advanced.  My experiences over the years include designing, developing and deploying to production environments an Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW).  The experiences and challenges involved in that time, really allowed me to master databases and SQL.  I am forever grateful to have been involved in that effort.
   
   When it comes to security, choosing Java as the destination language was a key decision for that.  C and C++ are notoriously known to be awful for security leaks in code.  Unfortunately, most of the code that is deployed in production systems all over the world is programmed in C.  Thankfully, most languages that have come about in the last 20 years have had a heavy shift towards security.  Java is one of those key languages.  Even though there has been this shift, Microsoft still supports this language, even in their Visual versions of the language.  Thankfully, they have also developed a new language called C# (C Sharp).  This language is a great blend of C and Java and has proven to be a powerful and safer language to develop in.  I am a big fan.
   
   The artifacts as they have evolved and have come together has been a grateful journey and has awakened a passion in me for the software developer in me.  If I had been a better manager of my procrastination, I feel that I would have done better on the GUI coding.  This project did once again help illuminate my code analysis skills, and that skill I continue to refine and hone.
   
   I chose to take an example application from a previous class, in C++, to demonstrate and show how languages have evolved and improved over the last two decades.  Along with that, the night and day development realities for software engineers.  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and support libraries.  Not having to reinvent the wheel when it comes to GUI-base applications, was a key turning point in my development career.  I grew up in the pre-GUI programmer times when GUI support libraries were a luxury.  Its been fun to watch the evolution of software development and programming, and I continue to be excited about the future.
